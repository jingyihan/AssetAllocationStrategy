## Stocastic Mean-Variance Optimization
A two-stage stochastic programming approach is implemented to the classic multi-period MVO strategy. This formulation incorporates the uncertainties in parameter estimations in the optimization problem and enables the multi-period rebalancing forecasting for periodic rebalancing framework adopting two-stage stochastic programming formulation and multi-period framework. Transaction cost and holding cost is considered in the model. Short selling can be either allowed or disallowed in the model based on userâ€™s selection.

### Derivation
Base on the single-period Hybrid MVO, the following stochastic program is formulated:
