## Carhart Four Factor Model

The Carhart Four Factor Model is a variation of the Fama-French three-factor model. It further extends the standard 3-factor Fama-French model by introducing a momentum factor. The momentum factor mainly captures the observed tendency for rising asset prices to rise further and falling assets prices to fall further. 

The Fama-French three-factor model was developed by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French to estimate expected stock returns via the expected factor returns and correlation to these factors. In this model, they incorporated the two additional factors â€“ average excess returns of small cap stocks over large cap stocks and average excess returns of value stocks overgrowth stocks - into the traditional Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to further measure and explain each asset return.

With the help of the Carhart four-factor model, the number of estimated parameters now is now greatly reduced. In addition, the following assumption was made:
