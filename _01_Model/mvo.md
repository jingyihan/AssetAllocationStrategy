## Classic Mean-Variance Optimization
Classic mean-variance optimization (MVO) model minimizes portfolio risk and allows the return of the portfolio meets investorâ€™s target. Cardinality-constrained MVO model adds the constrain that only fixed number of assets can be included every time the MVO model is rebalanced. Hence, this new MVO model becomes a mixed-integer quadratic program where a set of binary variables is added into the problem. The hybrid MVO model is set up as follow:
